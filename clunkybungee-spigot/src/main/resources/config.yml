CLUNKY_BUNGEE:
  # The allowed tokens to authenticate with the server.
  # These tokens are generated by the ClunkyBungee plugin in your bungeecord server.
  ALLOWED_TOKENS:
    - "Put the token here"

  # Kick message sent to connections without any forwarded data from the proxy.
  # Most likely a vanilla client connecting directly to the server, bypassing the proxy.
  NO_DATA_KICK_MESSAGE: "&cUnable to authenticate - no data was forwarded by the proxy."

  # Kick message sent to connections with forwarding data, but without a correct ClunkyBungee token
  # included in their handshake. Assuming ClunkyBungee is installed correctly on all proxies,
  # this is most likely a client trying to exploit the BungeeCord protocol to spoof their uuid.
  INVALID_TOKEN_KICK_MESSAGE: "&cUnable to authenticate."
